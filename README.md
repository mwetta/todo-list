# Todo List

## Description
This was my first large-scale project completed during The Odin Project. I learned a lot during this project, like:
* How to make my code modular and separate functionality
* How to implement CRUD
* How to use local storage
* How to debug my own code in a larger-scale project

Optimized for mobile (sort of) this was my biggest project to date, and one I remain very proud of, despite the fact that it's...a little ugly!

## Future Developments
This project is ripe for a major overhaul now that I've learned quite a bit more on the front and backend, and I'd be very excited to take a second look at it. A major refactor could include: 
* A backend database
* User authenticatioon
* React
* Responsive layout

Additional features could include:
* Tracking user completion of tasks
* Recurrence of tasks
* UI customizations (e.g., color-coding)
